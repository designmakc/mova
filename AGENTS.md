# AGENTS.md

> Operational guide for the AI agent running this workspace — canonical for every agent
> (Claude Code, opencode, Codex, Antigravity, or anything that reads markdown).
> `CLAUDE.md` points here. Conventions in this repo aren't etiquette; they're enforced by
> `npm test`.

## Which mode are you in?

Check `docs/reference/profile.md`:

- **It exists** → this is a personalized **instance**. Serve the learner: see "How a session
  runs" below and obey `docs/mechanics/`.
- **It does not exist, and the human wants to start learning** → run **setup**: follow
  [playbooks/setup.md](playbooks/setup.md). Interview first, generate second, verify third.
- **It does not exist, and the human is working on the template itself** → **maintainer
  mode**: [upstream/map.md](upstream/map.md) is the porting contract,
  [playbooks/sync-upstream.md](playbooks/sync-upstream.md) pulls limba's changes,
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records every released change with its `instance-impact:`.

## The one principle that governs everything

**The goal contract is the spec.** `docs/reference/goal.md` (generated at setup) names what
"done" means for this learner — an exam's sections, a level's can-do list, a scenario list,
or a ledger target — and one marked **spec sentence** is the tie-breaker for every scope
question. Work that serves no part of the goal contract is scope creep, however enriching.
An instance without a goal contract is mis-generated; stop and re-run that setup step.

## Verb table — what the human says, what you run

| The human says… | You follow… |
| --- | --- |
| "set up my workspace" | [playbooks/setup.md](playbooks/setup.md) |
| "lesson" (or shows up ready to study) | [playbooks/lesson.md](playbooks/lesson.md) |
| "drill" (short practice, review only) | [playbooks/drill.md](playbooks/drill.md) |
| "write" / "writing practice" | [playbooks/write.md](playbooks/write.md) |
| "mock" / "test me" | [playbooks/mock.md](playbooks/mock.md) |
| "review" / "weekly review" / "replan" | [playbooks/review.md](playbooks/review.md) |
| "add this word" / "what does X mean" (and wants it kept) | [playbooks/vocab.md](playbooks/vocab.md) |
| "retro" / "what did we learn" | [playbooks/retro.md](playbooks/retro.md) |
| "prep my tutor session" | [playbooks/tutor-prep.md](playbooks/tutor-prep.md) |
| "update the workspace" / "anything new?" / "check for updates" | [playbooks/update.md](playbooks/update.md) |

Per-agent command shims (e.g. `.claude/skills/`) are generated at setup and contain only
pointers to these playbooks. This table is the fallback that makes any agent work without
them. Playbooks are **verbs** and stay thin; shared rules live once, in `docs/mechanics/`
(**nouns**).

## Document map

| File | Read it when… |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/reference/profile.md` | **Every session, at orient** — who the learner is, their languages and ranking, the config block every script reads. |
| `docs/reference/goal.md` | Any scope question — the spec sentence, the assessment instrument, deadline math (or the no-deadline rule). |
| `docs/plan.md` | Current phase and routing for open work. Check before any session. |
| `docs/curriculum.md` | The current unit's targets (first `status: pending`). |
| `docs/mechanics/` | The rules in force: SRS, session format, teaching beats, media, verification. Playbooks obey these. |
| `docs/mechanics/why/` | **Only a retro reads this.** Why each rule exists — the incidents and measurements behind it. A study session never opens it. |
| `docs/mechanics/teaching.md` | **You're about to teach anything.** |
| `docs/mechanics/narration.md` | **You're about to say anything to the learner** — what to price, what to announce, what never to show them. Setup obeys it too. |
| `docs/reference/topics.md` | Coverage map — the arbiter for repair-vs-new-material. |
| `docs/reference/transfer.md` | You're explaining anything — contrast hooks and false friends for this learner's language pair. |
| `docs/visual/SPEC.md` | **You're about to build any page** — tokens, components; begin with `node scripts/newvisual.mjs <slug>`. |
| `docs/logs/` | Append-only session + error logs (`SES-NNN`, `ERR-NNN`). |
| `docs/snapshots/` | Frozen assessments, each with its "Not exercised:" list. |
| `state/` | The SRS ledgers — the workspace's memory. Edit only per `docs/mechanics/srs.md`. |
| `work/` | Produced artifacts: visuals, scored sets, writing, tutor packs, retro intake. |
| `packs/` | Language packs — the target language's grammar tables, normalization, dictionary adapter, voices. |

## Hard invariants (do not violate)

1. **The goal contract is the spec.** The tie-breaker for any scope question.
2. **State lives only in `state/` ledgers and `docs/logs/`.** Every session ends with the
   close-out ritual (`docs/mechanics/session_format.md`). A session that isn't logged didn't
   happen.
3. **Logs are append-only, newest-first, IDs strictly increasing.** Never edit or renumber an
   old entry; append a correcting one. Derive the next ID in the same turn as the append —
   use `scripts/log-append.mjs`.
4. **Docs and state stay under CI.** `npm test` after edits to plan, curriculum, topics,
   projects, or `state/`. The agent runs all tooling; the human never has to.
5. **No copyrighted content in the repo.** Cite by unit/page; files live untracked in
   `materials/`.
6. **Every language fact is verified, tutor-confirmed, or visibly marked unverified** —
   and every correction names the interference when there is one
   (`docs/mechanics/verification.md`).

## Session hygiene & git

One learner, sequential sessions: work directly on `main`, commit at every close-out
(`SES-NNN: <one-line summary>`), **naming the paths the session wrote** — never `git add -A`.
`playbooks/retro.md` is the one command safe to run in parallel; its concurrency rules bind
any session sharing the tree. Never discard uncommitted work you did not create.

## Status

Everything the verb table names exists and is CI-green: the engine (mechanics, scripts,
contract tests, the visual system), the Romanian reference pack, all eleven playbooks,
and the setup system. Three instances have been generated from this template and each
passed its own contract suite.

**Not yet exercised:** an actual study session — no lesson, drill, review or tutor pack
has ever run to completion. Adapters have only been generated for Claude Code. Romanian
is the only language pack. The update and sync paths are written but unrun. Treat those
as untested, not as broken; report what you find (see CHANGELOG.md).
