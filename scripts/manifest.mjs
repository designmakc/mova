// mova:engine
/**
 * Writes upstream/manifest.json — the engine-file hash manifest an instance's /update
 * playbook diffs against.
 *
 * The problem it solves: an instance is a fork of this template plus personal content,
 * and "what did the template change since I forked" has to be answerable mechanically.
 * The update playbook compares the instance's stored manifest against the template's
 * current one; a path whose hash moved is an engine change to pull, a path missing here
 * was never the engine's to touch.
 *
 * What counts as an engine file: any tracked-extension file whose FIRST line carries the
 * `mova:engine` marker (second line when the first is a shebang — .sh keeps its shebang
 * first). JSON cannot carry a comment, so markerless engine files live on an explicit
 * include list instead. A file without the marker is instance/pack content and is
 * deliberately absent: hashing it would make /update flag the learner's own edits.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/manifest.mjs        (run before every release; CI may re-run it)
 *
 * Output shape:
 *   { "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD", "template_version": "<VERSION>",
 *     "files": { "<repo-relative path>": "<sha256>" } }
 *
 * Read-only except for its one output. Zero dependencies (node:crypto).

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- the pack baseline */

/**
 * `upstream/packs.json` — the same idea as the manifest, for the packs the template ships.
 *
 * It is a SEPARATE file on purpose. The manifest is `/update`'s allowlist and its rule is
 * absolute: what is in it may be replaced, what is not is the learner's. Pack files are
 * `mova:pack` and stay out of it, because hashing them would make every update flag a
 * learner's correction to their own language facts.
 *
 * But that left a pack unable to reach an existing instance at all. This file is the missing
 * half: it answers *"did this workspace's pack come from a template, and which one"* without
 * granting `/update` permission to overwrite it. `playbooks/update.md` § 6b reads it to tell
 * three states apart —
 *
 *   - the instance's pack matches a shipped one  ⇒ it is the template's; a newer one can be
 *     offered as an update;
 *   - it differs from the shipped one            ⇒ the learner corrected it, or setup
 *     generated it before the language shipped; ask, never assume;
 *   - the template ships no pack for this code   ⇒ nothing to say.
 *
 * The offer itself is always gated on `scripts/packdiff.mjs`, which answers the only
 * question that matters: what breaks for THIS learner.
